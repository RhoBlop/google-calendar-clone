# Simple Google Calendar Clone
This is a simple clone of google calendar that involves basic events creation and editing. There's none database nor data persistence, besides on local storage.<br>
It's basically a project I've done with pure react to consolidate my knowledge on it and learn the logic behind calendars' programming.
